    "Pip is Pythonâ€™s package manager, providing essential core features for installing and maintaining Python packages and their dependencies. While many Python developers use Pip as a Dependency Manager, it was never intended to be used as one. Pip will not flag dependency conflicts. As a result, it will happily install multiple versions of a dependency into your project, which will likely result in errors."
